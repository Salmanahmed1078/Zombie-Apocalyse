# Zombie Apocalypse Game

## Overview

**Zombie Apocalypse** is a console-based C++ game where players navigate a graph-based maze, avoid zombies, collect items, and reach a safe zone. The game offers manual and auto modes, a scoring system, inventory management, and high score tracking. The map is represented as a graph, with nodes connected to form paths, walls, and game elements.

## Features

### Game Modes

- **Manual Mode**: Control the player using WASD keys to move through the maze.
- **Auto Mode**: A Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm automatically navigates to the safe zone.

### Graph-Based Map

- Nodes represent positions, connected by edges for valid movements.
- Includes walls (`â–ˆ`), items (`*`), zombies (`Z`), the player (`P`), and the safe zone (`S`).

### Gameplay Mechanics

- Zombies move randomly, deducting 40 health on contact.
- Items:
  - Medkit, Food, 2X multiplier provide health or score bonuses.
- Reach the safe zone to win, or lose if health reaches zero.

### Scoring and Inventory

- **Score Formula**:  
  `Score = (inventory.totalItemValue + distanceTraveled) * 2  -(zombiesEncountered * 10)`
- Inventory tracks collected items.

### High Scores

- Stored in `score.txt`
- Displayed in a sorted leaderboard.

### Console Interface

- ASCII art for home, win, and end screens.
- Animated loading bar and zombie movement on the home screen.
- Color-coded output for walls, items, and UI elements.
